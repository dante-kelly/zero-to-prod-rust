# zero-to-prod-rust
In the world of programming, you either die on the JavaScript hill or you live long enough to become a Rustacean

## What is this?
This is a development project on progress from the book Zero to Production in Rust. I will most likely add additional abstract test code to supplement learning in this book.

## How to run
1. Install rust through https://rustup.rs/.
2. `cd` into the desired project folder.
3. Run `cargo run` to run the project.
